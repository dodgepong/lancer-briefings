# Ynn, Yga Pocket, Sparr // 2.21.5016u
**REYNAR YYVORS** assembled a squad of scrappy pilots to being a new attempt at his Road Carving, recruiting ex-convict **SILENT SPARROW** and child gladiator prodigy **M-L** in an effort to work for **LOS VOLADORES** as **ESPADAS**.

Upon the arrival of the ***BAJAMESA***, Reynar arranged a meeting with Volador **HALCONA**, who decided to test the mettle of this new team by pitting them against another aspiring squad lead by Reynar's nephew, **BRONDULF YYVORS**. The mission was simple: hunt an Amarok in the caverns below Ynn and be the first to return with its claws as a trophy.

The squad spent time researching the Amarok to discover its weaknesses and sabotaged one of the opposing mechs, then proceeded to deftly navigate the vast caverns of Ynn to find an Amarok sleeping soundly. The squad got the jump on the beast, but not before Brondulf and his crew showed up to make matters worse.

With a direct headshot, Silent Sparrow brought down the Amarok, and rained hell on the opposing mechs. Tengu unleashed the full force of his hacking capabilities to disrupt them, and Pequad ripped into their hulls with his energy sword. After the snow cleared, the squad was left as the clear victors.

Upon returning to Halcona with the claws, she granted them the position of espada, and had the claws fashioned into fearsome weapons for one of the squad to wield in battle.
